This lesson is about HTML. In particular, we will:

-   Talk about the difference between HTML "nodes", "tags", and "elements".
-   Distinguish between "block" and "inline" elements.
-   Look at a few HTML attributes.
-   Look at some of the most common HTML tags.

----------

  

#### **SETUP**

From your command line, create an index.html file, open it in your code editor (e.g VS Code, Notepad, PyCharm...), and add the following **boilerplate** to it:

  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body><!-- your HTML goes here -->
</body>

</html>
```
  

Test things out (a habit we need to form) by opening your **index.html** in your browser. Everything working as expected?

----------

  

#### **REMINDER**

Remember, except for the **boilerplate** HTML - **any HTML you write must be in the** **body** **tag** - that is, between these two:

```html
<body>

  <!-- Your HTML goes here! -->
  
</body>
```
